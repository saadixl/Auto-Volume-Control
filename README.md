# Auto-Volume-Control

Sometimes I get tired of adjusting volume while watching a war movie. The fighting scene can suddenly become very loud. Then the normal conversation can again become very quiet. Can we find a automated solution? That's why I am trying to make the volume control automated. The plan is simple, listen to the mic and adjust the volume depending on the noise being produced.

- Also please allow the browser to use your mic.
